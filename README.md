# CDead
CDead can check dead words, and the amount of said dead words, within an essay or paragraph(s) inputted within a text file. CDead automatically highlights the places where dead words are found.

## Instructions
A) Install Python 3 via their [Download site.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

B) Download the code

C) Run `main.py`. Modules should be automatically installed by CDead.

## Usage
Type or copy-and-paste in text into `type_in_here.txt`. Save the file and run `main.py` in the *terminal*, NOT IDLE shell. CDead will attempt to install modules necessary to its functions. Once this is done, it will display the text in `type_in_here.txt` in the terminal. Highlighted red are dead words that CDead has found.

You may change the text in `type_in_here.txt` and re-process the file by entering in "y". Entering in anything else will close CDEad.
